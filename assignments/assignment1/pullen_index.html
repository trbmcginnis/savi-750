  <h1> Reality Properties: Fake Estates</h1>
   <p>analysis of Sara Eichner's story map</p>


<p>Who: Visual Artist Sara Eichner made this map in a class with Eric Brelsford, Advanced Web Mapping at Pratt Institute in 2016. 

<p>What: Gordon Matta Clark's 1973 project called Fake Estates is presented on the left, with with contemporary maps of odd lots in New York City on the right. </p>

<p>Why?: The map has great style. Visual artist Sara Eichner visualizes a significant conceptual artwork online in a contemporary context.</p>

<p>Data: Street addresses come from monographs on the artists' work. Eichner correlates these by block and lot number to data from NYC Oasis interactive landuse maps and MapsPluto with images of deeds, transfer files, past and current estimated values. </p>

<p>How: Scroll down. Javascript syncs a map the story you are reading. Seeing two kinds of information at once is cool. Leaflet plugin, google fonts api, with Cloudflare and JQuery, Carto, hosted on Github.io website.  </p>
